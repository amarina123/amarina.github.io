                                    <p class="text-muted">I was taking a bus from Delhi to Jalandhar and noticed the amount of paper trash that littered the streets. It wasn't just a couple flying around in the wind, but piles of trash that went on for a 7-hour ride. Seeing my ancestor's country littered with trash instilled in me a motive to see change. I wanted to reuse the paper for a better purpose, and so I combined my love for aerospace and origami to have the idea of teaching children how to make a paper airplane out of the trash that littered the streets, and learn the aerodynamics behind it.</p>

                                    <p class="text-muted">My next visit to India was during winter, but my idea had stuck with me. I walked to the slums of my village and on the way I brought a trash bag in which I collected all the paper litter that gathered around the streets. I met with the children and we gathered in a circle as I handed them the paper I had collected. Step-by-step we created a bunch of paper airplanes from the trash as I explained the aerodynamics and why we were doing this, leaving an interest in flight and environmental concerns to those who never knew of it. By the end of the day, the sky was filled with reused paper airplanes that were gathered as souvenirs or discarded in the recycling bin I had given, and the first time was a success.</p>

                                    <p class="text-muted">In a month I had filled over 100 trash bags, and created a recycling system in 20 different slums. I was able to single-handedly inspire many children who didn't know what environment or planes even meant to start caring for the place they call home and fall in love with aerospace engineering as I have. Before I left, I wanted to make sure my work would continue on, and I knew I had to reach out to others to create an organization. With the help of the local high schools, I was able to create a program that would continue to gather trash and teach origami of all kinds, and the science behind it to spark children's minds.</p>
