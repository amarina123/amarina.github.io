                    <p class="text-muted">With over 7,000 bags of trash gathered, with every piece of origami you eliminate the litter on the streets. From old newspapers to sheets of paper, instead of a dog or cow eating it, you can create a multitude of things from folding the paper.</p>

                    <h4 class="service-heading">Origami</h4>
                    <p class="text-muted">The trash gathered turns into origami. Most of the children residing in the slums didn't even know what origami was until we demonstrated it with a plane. This initiates the creative mind, and gives a meaningful way to recycle paper that is easily accesible.</p>

                    <p class="text-muted">Through origami we want to explain how the things we make work. I used paper planes to instill the lessons of aerodynamics in young minds and create a passion for aerospace engineering. Most of these children have never seen a boat, and only see planes in the sky so through this they can relate to it on another level./p>
