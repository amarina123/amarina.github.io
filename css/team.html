                    <h3 class="section-subheading text-muted">My name is Amarina Rai and my mission is to eliminate the amount of trash that resides the streets of India through teaching origami. Every summer and winter I would go to India and see the amount of trash that fills the streets. Everyone in the city is accustomed to it, and some even contribute to the trash outside. The children in the slums have to live with the reprecautions. I wanted to spark an artistic and educational interest in the children of the slums, as they don't get these opportunities. My passion is aerospace engineering, and by creating this program I was able to share my passion with these children by creating paper planes and explaining the aerodynamics behind them. Some of them had never even seen a plane before, and little did they know what aerodynamics meant. After we finished building planes, they all had a newfound appreciation for the paper trash that littered their humble abode and aerospace as a whole. Through this they also learned how to care more for their environment and recycle. I wanted to create this volunteer program so that other slums could get education and get inspired through origami.</h3>
